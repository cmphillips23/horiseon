HORISEON PROJECT

In this challenge, I refactored the existing code that we were given.  This code is for a web page for a mock company called Horiseon, which advertises itself as a company used for search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing.  The web page was already fully-functional, but I edited the html and the css files to make it more simplified and accessible.

Here is a link to the deployed web page:
